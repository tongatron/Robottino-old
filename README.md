Plug an Arduino board on its back, then set the instructions and combining components: a small display, sensor, sounds, coloured lights and a little motor to spin the head.

Robottino is an Arduino shield and works with Arduino boards: Uno, Leonardo, YÃ¹n (web connection) and many others.

Note that the RobottinoYun codes are stored in a private repository, because they still contanin users and passwords fot the web services. Feel free to ssk if you want to join the RobottinoYun repository.  

Robottino is still a prototype. Need to work on: design, circuits and developing software libraries, examples and tutorials to make programming as easy as possible.
