#Robottino
## interactive and programmable robo-head

Plug an Arduino board on its back, then set the instructions and combining components: a small display, sensor, sounds, coloured lights and a little motor to spin the head.

Robottino is an Arduino shield and works with Arduino boards: Uno, Leonardo, Yùn (web connection) and many others.

Robottino is still a prototype. Need to work on: design, circuits and developing software libraries, examples and tutorials to make programming as easy as possible.

Note that the RobottinoYun codes are stored in a private repository, because they still caontains users and passwords for the web services. Feel free to ask if you want to join the RobottinoYun repository.  



### NEXT STEPS
1) **library**: main functions need to be as simple as possibile, like a “Robottino for dummies”. Example: Robottino.writeRGB(255, 0, 0), RobottinoReadAntennas, RobottinoSpinTheHead...  
2) more examples, functions, tutorials, demos, actions, interactions...   
3) looking for compatibility to some simple programming interface, like S4A
